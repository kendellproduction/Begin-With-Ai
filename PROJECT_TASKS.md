## ðŸ“š Detailed Task Breakdowns

### 1. Project Health & Optimization

#### 1.1. Dependency & Build System
- **[COMPLETED] Resolve Node Corruption:** The `package.json` has been updated to use exact versions for all dependencies, and all peer dependency conflicts have been resolved. A clean `npm install` has been successfully executed.
- **[HIGH] Migrate to Vite:** Replace `react-scripts` (Create React App) with Vite to gain significant performance improvements in development and production.
- **[HIGH] Implement Code Splitting:** Use `React.lazy()` for all page-level components in `src/App.js` to reduce initial bundle size and improve load times.
- **[HIGH] Configure ESLint:** Set up ESLint with a standard configuration (e.g., `eslint-config-react-app`) to enforce code quality and find errors.
- **[HIGH] Audit NPM Packages:** Use a tool like `depcheck` to identify and remove any dependencies that are no longer used in the project.

### 2. Admin Panel Overhaul (from `ADMIN_PANEL_OVERHAUL_PLAN.md`)

#### 2.1. Foundation (Critical)
- **[CRITICAL] Consolidate Builders:**
  - Audit all current admin components.
  - Remove `LessonBuilder.js`, `EnterpriseBuilder.js`, `LessonEditor.js`.
  - Refactor all logic into `UnifiedLessonBuilder.js`.
- **[CRITICAL] Data Architecture:**
  - Update lesson data model in Firestore to use Free/Premium tiers instead of difficulty levels.
  - Add `draft` and `published` states to lessons.
  - Create a dedicated `drafts` collection in Firestore.
- **[CRITICAL] Manual Save System:**
  - Implement `AdminContext` for state management during lesson editing.
  - Add robust unsaved changes detection.
  - Create prominent "Save" button and "Exit with unsaved changes?" prompts.

#### 2.2. UI/UX (High)
- **[HIGH] Webflow-Inspired Layout:** Implement the three-column layout (Content Blocks, Settings, Preview) with a glass-morphism aesthetic.
- **[HIGH] Free/Premium Toggle:** Create the UI toggle to switch between editing content for free vs. premium users.
- **[HIGH] Content Block Implementation:**
  - Build the base component for all drag-and-drop content blocks.
  - Fully implement the Text, Image (with uploads), Video, Quiz, and Sandbox blocks.
- **[MEDIUM] Advanced Blocks & Settings:**
  - Implement Podcast and other interactive block types.
  - Build out the full settings panel, including SEO, analytics, design, and media management.

### 3. V1 Launch & Optimization (from `OPTIMIZATION_CHECKLIST.md` and `V1_LAUNCH_TODO_LIST.md`)

#### 3.1. Core Features & Cleanup (Critical)
- **[CRITICAL] Re-enable Routes:**
  - Uncomment the routes for `AdminPanel`, `AiNews`, and `Pricing` in `src/App.js`.
- **[CRITICAL] Enable PWA:** Rename `public/manifest.json.disabled` to `public/manifest.json`.
- **[CRITICAL] Fix Analytics:** Resolve the "API issues" preventing Firebase Analytics from initializing in `src/firebase.js`.
- **[CRITICAL] Remove `console.log`s:** Systematically remove all debug logs from the production codebase, especially in `src/firebase.js` and `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`.

#### 3.2. Functional Fixes & Testing (High)
- **[HIGH] Error Handling:** Implement user-friendly fallbacks and error messages for all critical API calls and user flows.
- **[HIGH] Bug Reporting:** Fix the Gmail authentication issue in the bug report cloud function.

- **[MEDIUM] Mobile Experience:** Conduct end-to-end testing of all user flows on mobile devices, including touch interactions and PWA behavior.

#### 3.3. Security & Monitoring (High)
- **[HIGH] Firebase Security Rules:** Perform a full audit of your Firestore rules to ensure they are secure for production.
