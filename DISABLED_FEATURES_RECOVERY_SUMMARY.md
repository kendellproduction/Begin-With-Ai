## üîß Immediate Next Steps for Production

### 1. **Environment Setup** (Required)
```bash
# Copy template and configure
cp ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md .env.production
# Fill in your actual API keys and configuration
```

### 2. **Admin User Configuration** (Required for Admin Panel)
```javascript
// In Firestore console, update user document:
{
  "role": "admin",  // or "developer"
  // ... other user fields
}
```

### 3. **Firebase Security Rules** (Critical)
- Deploy the enhanced security rules from `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- Test role-based access in staging environment

### 4. **API Integration** (Optional but Recommended)
- Configure at least one AI API (OpenAI recommended)
- Set up search APIs for dynamic AI news (optional)
- Configure Stripe for payment processing (if monetizing)

### 5. **Testing & Validation**
```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
npm run health-check

# Test all features in staging
# Test admin access with different user roles
# Validate PWA installation on mobile devices
```
