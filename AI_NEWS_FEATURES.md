## ❤️ **How the Like System Works**

### Simulated Engagement (Older Articles)
```javascript
// For articles older than 1 hour:
- Base engagement = hours since published × 2
- Random boost = 0-25 additional likes  
- Cap at 150 maximum simulated likes
- Shows as "engagement" not "fake likes"
```

### Real User Likes
- ✅ **Authenticated users** can like/unlike articles
- ✅ **Real-time updates** across all users
- ✅ **Persistent storage** in Firestore
- ✅ **Prevents duplicate likes** per user

### Engagement Display
```javascript
// Example engagement breakdown:
{
  likes: {
    simulated: 25,  // Community engagement simulation
    real: 8,        // Actual user likes
    total: 33       // Combined total shown
  }
}
```
