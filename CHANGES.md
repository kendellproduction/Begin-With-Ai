- **Learning Path**: 4 modules (AI Foundations, Core Prompting, Creative Applications, Practical Applications)
- **Interactive Sandboxes**: Multiple sandbox types configured for hands-on learning
- **Real Content**: Replaced all placeholder lessons with actual educational content

### üîß **Technical Implementation**
- **AdaptiveLessonService**: Complete service for dynamic lesson loading and difficulty adaptation
- **Firebase Integration**: Hierarchical database structure (Learning Paths ‚Üí Modules ‚Üí Lessons)  
- **Security Rules**: Updated Firebase rules to allow seeding while maintaining production security
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for missing lesson properties
- **UI Components**: Enhanced lesson cards, explore interface, and home page integration

### üöÄ **User Experience**
- **Home Page**: Prominently displays learning path progress with visual progress circle
- **Lessons Explore**: Desktop grid and mobile swipe interface with real lesson content
- **Adaptive Assessment**: 10-question quiz system for skill level determination
- **Progress Tracking**: Integration with existing gamification system (XP, levels, badges)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Development Tools**
- **Database Seeder**: One-click seeding tool for lesson content
- **Minimized Interface**: Collapsible seeder that doesn't interfere with UI
- **Debug Tools**: Temporary authentication and database checking (now removed)

### üìä **Content Structure**
```
Prompt Engineering Mastery (10 lessons)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AI Foundations (3 lessons)
