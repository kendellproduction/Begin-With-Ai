## 🎧 **V1 REDESIGN: PODCAST-POWERED LESSONS**

> **DECISION**: Integrate podcast-powered lesson redesign directly into V1 since current lessons need significant improvements anyway.
> 
> **Goals:**
> - Single-page scroll-based learning journey with embedded podcast
> - Modern drag-and-drop admin builder (Webflow/Figma-style)
> - Premium Spotify-like podcast player (sticky/floating)
> - Modular content blocks (text, image, quiz, sandbox, video)
> - Mobile-first responsive design with touch optimization
> - Enterprise-grade polish for both user and admin experiences

## 📱 MOBILE-FIRST DEVELOPMENT REMINDER

> **CRITICAL**: Every development decision must consider mobile scalability, user experience, and SECURITY first.
> 
> **Always Ask:**
> - How will this perform on slower mobile connections?
> - Is this feature touch-friendly and accessible on small screens?
> - Does this scale gracefully as our user base grows from hundreds to thousands to millions?
> - Are we optimizing for Core Web Vitals and mobile performance?
> - How does this impact our mobile PWA experience?
> 
> **🛡️ SECURITY-FIRST DEVELOPMENT (CRITICAL):**
> - **NO BACKDOORS**: Never create hidden access points, debug endpoints, or bypass mechanisms
> - **SANITIZE ALL INPUT**: Use DOMPurify for ALL user content (code, text, file uploads, podcast URLs)
> - **VALIDATE EVERYTHING**: Server-side validation for all API calls and user data
> - **SANDBOX CODE EXECUTION**: All user code runs in WebAssembly isolation (Pyodide/Wasmer)
> - **AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED**: No sensitive operations without proper Firebase Auth verification
> - **RATE LIMITING**: Protect all endpoints from abuse and DoS attacks
> - **NO SECRETS IN CODE**: Environment variables only, never hardcoded API keys
> - **SQL INJECTION PREVENTION**: Parameterized queries only, never string concatenation
> - **XSS PROTECTION**: Content Security Policy headers and input sanitization
> - **SECURE HEADERS**: Implement helmet.js for security headers
> - **SESSION SECURITY**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies with proper timeout
> - **ERROR HANDLING**: Never expose internal system details in error messages
> - **GDPR/CCPA COMPLIANCE**: Data deletion and export capabilities built-in
> - **AUDIT TRAIL**: Log security-relevant actions for monitoring
> 
> **Mobile Success Metrics:**
> - Loading time on 3G: <5 seconds
> - Touch targets: minimum 44px
> - One-handed navigation capability
> - Offline functionality where possible
> - Battery-conscious performance
> - **Security Score: 100% (No vulnerabilities allowed)**
> 
> **🚨 SECURITY CHECKLIST - MUST VERIFY BEFORE ANY DEPLOYMENT:**
> - [ ] All user inputs sanitized with DOMPurify
> - [ ] All API endpoints require authentication
> - [ ] Rate limiting implemented on all user-facing endpoints
> - [ ] No hardcoded secrets or API keys in source code
> - [ ] All database queries use parameterized statements
> - [ ] Content Security Policy headers configured
> - [ ] Error messages don't expose system internals
> - [ ] User code execution properly sandboxed
> - [ ] File uploads validated and sanitized
> - [ ] Session management secure (HttpOnly, Secure flags)
