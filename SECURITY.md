# Security Guidelines for BeginningWithAI

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the BeginningWithAI learning platform.

## Authentication and User Data

### Email and Password Authentication
- Passwords are never stored in plaintext
- Password requirements: minimum 8 characters, must include letters, numbers, and symbols
- Email verification is required for full account access
- Rate limiting is applied to login attempts

### Third-party Authentication
- Google Sign-In integration uses OAuth 2.0
- Only necessary user profile information is stored (email, display name)

### User Data Storage
- User progress is stored in Firebase Firestore with proper security rules
- Each user can only access their own data
- Sensitive operations require re-authentication

## Code Execution Sandbox

### Iframe Sandboxing
- All user code runs in a sandboxed iframe with restricted permissions
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers prevent unauthorized resource access
- Network access is blocked by default
- File system access is prevented

### Execution Limits
- Code execution timeout prevents infinite loops (5 second default)
- Memory usage is monitored and limited
- CPU usage is monitored to prevent resource abuse

## Content Security

### Content Security Policy
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' https://apis.google.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https://*.googleapis.com https://*.gstatic.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://*.firebaseio.com https://*.googleapis.com;
  frame-src 'self' https://*.firebaseapp.com;
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  form-action 'self';
">
```

### HTTPS Configuration
- HTTPS is enforced for all connections
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled
- Modern TLS protocols and ciphers only

### Password Strength Enforcement
- Client-side validation ensures strong passwords
- Server-side validation as additional security layer
- Feedback provided to users on password strength

## Data Backup and Recovery
- Regular automated backups of Firestore data
- Secure recovery procedures in place
- Data retention policies follow best practices

## Regular Security Auditing
- Dependencies are regularly updated to patch vulnerabilities
- Code reviews include security considerations
- Periodic penetration testing

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please email security@beginningwithai.com with details.
Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been addressed.

## User Privacy
- Users can export or delete their data at any time
- Only necessary data is collected for functionality
- Clear privacy policy explains data usage
